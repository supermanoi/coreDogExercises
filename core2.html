            The idea that dogs hate cats may have been born because dogs chase
            cats and grew because cartoons depicted ongoing battles between the
            two species. Or it may have been generated because some dog people
            strongly dislike cats and some cat people disdain dogs. However,
            dogs and cats can live peaceably as long as owners understand the
            behaviors of each.

            In some cases, a resident cat will isolate itself when a puppy is
            added to the family. In other cases, cats and dogs never get used to
            each other. In still other cases, cat or kitten and dog or puppy
            play together and build a friendship that finds them curled up
            together in a crate or bed and drinking out of the same bowl. The
            type of relationship developed in each household depends on the
            personality of the animals and the understanding of the owners.
